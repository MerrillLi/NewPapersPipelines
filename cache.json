We\ntry to narrow the gap by mining the potential of VLMs for better performance\nand any-to-any workflow from three aspects, i.e., high-resolution visual\ntokens, high-quality data, and VLM-guided generation. To enhance visual tokens,\nwe propose to utilize an additional visual encoder for high-resolution\nrefinement without increasing the visual token count. We further construct a\nhigh-quality dataset that promotes precise image comprehension and\nreasoning-based generation, expanding the operational scope of current VLMs. In\ngeneral, Mini-Gemini further mines the potential of VLMs and empowers current\nframeworks with image understanding, reasoning, and generation simultaneously.\nMini-Gemini supports a series of dense and MoE Large Language Models (LLMs)\nfrom 2B to 34B.

While this simplicity is attractive, it is necessary to train such\nmodels on large and varied datasets, which are difficult to capture. It has\nbeen shown that using embeddings from pre-trained foundational models, such as\nCLIP, improves zero shot transfer in several applications. Taking inspiration\nfrom this, in our paper we explore the use of global image priors generated\nfrom a pre-trained ViT model to provide more detailed contextual information.\nWe argue that the embedding vector from a ViT model, pre-trained on a large\ndataset, captures greater relevant information for SIDE than the usual route of\ngenerating pseudo image captions, followed by CLIP based text embeddings. Based\non this idea, we propose a new SIDE model using a diffusion backbone which is\nconditioned on ViT embeddings.

Furthermore,\nwe propose extending F1 score as an aggregated metric for long-form factuality.\nTo do so, we balance the percentage of supported facts in a response\n(precision) with the percentage of provided facts relative to a hyperparameter\nrepresenting a user's preferred response length (recall).\n  Empirically, we demonstrate that LLM agents can achieve superhuman rating\nperformance - on a set of ~16k individual facts, SAFE agrees with crowdsourced\nhuman annotators 72% of the time, and on a random subset of 100 disagreement\ncases, SAFE wins 76% of the time.

While the effect of\ndelays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they\ninteract with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time\nperformance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main\ncontribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA\nupdate rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \\emph{last\niterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is\n\\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the\nmixing time $\\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel\ninductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization\nanalyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such,\nour proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the\nmaximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time\nanalysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling. In particular,\nwe show that the exponent of convergence of this scheme gets scaled down by\n$\\tau_{avg}$, as opposed to $\\tau_{max}$ for the vanilla delayed SA rule; here,\n$\\tau_{avg}$ denotes the average delay across all iterations.

One key factor of the\ngreat comprehension power of the large language model is that natural language\ntokenizers utilize meaningful words or subwords as the basic elements of\nlanguage. In contrast, mainstream visual tokenizers, represented by patch-based\nmethods such as Patch Embed, rely on meaningless rectangular patches as basic\nelements of vision, which cannot serve as effectively as words or subwords in\nlanguage. Starting from the essence of the tokenizer, we defined semantically\nindependent regions (SIRs) for vision. We designed a simple HOmogeneous visual\ntOKenizer: HOOK. HOOK mainly consists of two modules: the Object Perception\nModule (OPM) and the Object Vectorization Module (OVM). To achieve homogeneity,\nthe OPM splits the image into 4*4 pixel seeds and then utilizes the attention\nmechanism to perceive SIRs. The OVM employs cross-attention to merge seeds\nwithin the same SIR. To achieve adaptability, the OVM defines a variable number\nof learnable vectors as cross-attention queries, allowing for the adjustment of\ntoken quantity. We conducted experiments on the NWPU-RESISC45, WHU-RS19\nclassification dataset, and GID5 segmentation dataset for sparse and dense\ntasks. The results demonstrate that the visual tokens obtained by HOOK\ncorrespond to individual objects, which demonstrates homogeneity. HOOK\noutperformed Patch Embed by 6\\% and 10\\% in the two tasks and achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance compared to the baselines used for comparison.\nCompared to Patch Embed, which requires more than one hundred tokens for one\nimage, HOOK requires only 6 and 8 tokens for sparse and dense tasks,\nrespectively, resulting in efficiency improvements of 1.5 to 2.8 times.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, proposed a\nstandard method for ET0 computation (FAO56PM), based on the parameterization of\nthe Penman-Monteith equation, that is widely adopted in the literature. To\ncompute ET0 using the FAO56-PM method, four main weather parameters are needed:\ntemperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation (SR). One way to make daily\nET0 estimations for future days is to use freely available weather forecast\nservices (WFSs), where many meteorological parameters are estimated up to the\nnext 15 days. A problem with this method is that currently, SR is not provided\nas a free forecast parameter on most of those online services or, normally,\nsuch forecasts present a financial cost penalty. For this reason, several ET0\nestimation models using machine and deep learning were developed and presented\nin the literature, that use as input features a reduced set of carefully\nselected weather parameters, that are compatible with common freely available\nWFSs. However, most studies on this topic have only evaluated model performance\nusing data from weather stations (WSs), without considering the effect of using\nweather forecast data. In this study, the performance of authors' previous\nmodels is evaluated when using weather forecast data from two online WFSs, in\nthe following scenarios: (i) direct ET0 estimation by an ANN model, and (ii)\nestimate SR by ANN model, and then use that estimation for ET0 computation,\nusing the FAO56-PM method. Employing data collected from two WFSs and a WS\nlocated in Vale do Lobo, Portugal, the latter approach achieved the best\nresult, with a coefficient of determination (R2) ranging between 0.893 and\n0.667, when considering forecasts up to 15 days.\n","authors":["Pedro J.

Existing world models are autoregressive in that they\ninterleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the\npolicy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows.\nIn this work, we propose a novel world modelling approach that is not\nautoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass\nthrough a diffusion model. Our approach, Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion\n(PolyGRAD), leverages a denoising model in addition to the gradient of the\naction distribution of the policy to diffuse a trajectory of initially random\nstates and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory. We analyse the\nconnections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models, and\nclassifier-guided diffusion models. Our results demonstrate that PolyGRAD\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of trajectory prediction error\nfor short trajectories, with the exception of autoregressive diffusion. For\nshort trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains similar errors to autoregressive\ndiffusion, but with lower computational requirements. For long trajectories,\nPolyGRAD obtains comparable performance to baselines.

In this work, we consider decision-making and probabilistic planning\nin stochastic systems modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs), given a\npartially ordered preference over a set of temporally extended goals.\nSpecifically, each temporally extended goal is expressed using a formula in\nLinear Temporal Logic on Finite Traces (LTL$_f$). To plan with the partially\nordered preference, we introduce order theory to map a preference over temporal\ngoals to a preference over policies for the MDP. Accordingly, a most preferred\npolicy under a stochastic ordering induces a stochastic nondominated\nprobability distribution over the finite paths in the MDP. To synthesize a most\npreferred policy, our technical approach includes two key steps. In the first\nstep, we develop a procedure to transform a partially ordered preference over\ntemporal goals into a computational model, called preference automaton, which\nis a semi-automaton with a partial order over acceptance conditions. In the\nsecond step, we prove that finding a most preferred policy is equivalent to\ncomputing a Pareto-optimal policy in a multi-objective MDP that is constructed\nfrom the original MDP, the preference automaton, and the chosen stochastic\nordering relation.

In recent years, imitation learning that\naims to learn from expert demonstrations has been proposed as a viable\nalternative to solving these problems. Generally speaking, imitation learning\nis designed to learn either the reward (or preference) model or directly the\nbehavioral policy by observing the behavior of an expert. Existing work in\nimitation learning and inverse reinforcement learning has focused on imitation\nprimarily in unconstrained settings (e.g., no limit on fuel consumed by the\nvehicle). However, in many real-world domains, the behavior of an expert is\ngoverned not only by reward (or preference) but also by constraints. For\ninstance, decisions on self-driving delivery vehicles are dependent not only on\nthe route preferences/rewards (depending on past demand data) but also on the\nfuel in the vehicle and the time available. In such problems, imitation\nlearning is challenging as decisions are not only dictated by the reward model\nbut are also dependent on a cost-constrained model.

We find that Gemini is highly accurate in\nperforming object detection, which is arguably the most common and fundamental\ntask in image analysis for political scientists. Equally important, we show\nthat it is easy to implement as the entire command consists of a single prompt\nin natural language; it is fast to run and should meet the time budget of most\nresearchers; and it is free to use and does not require any specialized\nhardware. In addition, we illustrate how political scientists can leverage\nGemini for other image understanding tasks, including face identification,\nsentiment analysis, and caption generation.

Due to multimodal sensors equipped by the LEO satellites, they serve\nnot only for communication but also for various machine learning applications,\nsuch as space modulation recognition, remote sensing image classification, etc.\nHowever, the ground station (GS) may be incapable of downloading such a large\nvolume of raw sensing data for centralized model training due to the limited\ncontact time with LEO satellites (e.g. 5 minutes). Therefore, federated\nlearning (FL) has emerged as the promising solution to address this problem via\non-device training. Unfortunately, to enable FL on LEO satellites, we still\nface three critical challenges that are i) heterogeneous computing and memory\ncapabilities, ii) limited uplink rate, and iii) model staleness. To this end,\nwe propose FedSN as a general FL framework to tackle the above challenges, and\nfully explore data diversity on LEO satellites. Specifically, we first present\na novel sub-structure scheme to enable heterogeneous local model training\nconsidering different computing, memory, and communication constraints on LEO\nsatellites. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-synchronous model aggregation\nstrategy to dynamically schedule model aggregation for compensating model\nstaleness. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the FedSN, we evaluate\nit using space modulation recognition and remote sensing image classification\ntasks by leveraging the data from real-world satellite networks. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that FedSN framework achieves higher accuracy,\nlower computing, and communication overhead than the state-of-the-art\nbenchmarks and the effectiveness of each components in FedSN.\n","authors":["Zheng Lin","Zhe Chen","Zihan Fang","Xianhao Chen","Xiong Wang","Yue Gao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01483v3.pdf","comment":"14 pages, 17 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18756v1","updated":"2024-03-27T16:56:14Z","published":"2024-03-27T16:56:14Z","title":"Detection of subclinical atherosclerosis by image-based deep learning on\n  chest x-ray","summary":"  Aims. To develop a deep-learning based system for recognition of subclinical\natherosclerosis on a plain frontal chest x-ray. Methods and Results. A\ndeep-learning algorithm to predict coronary artery calcium (CAC) score (the\nAI-CAC model) was developed on 460 chest x-ray (80% training cohort, 20%\ninternal validation cohort) of primary prevention patients (58.4% male, median\nage 63 [51-74] years) with available paired chest x-ray and chest computed\ntomography (CT) indicated for any clinical reason and performed within 3\nmonths. The CAC score calculated on chest CT was used as ground truth. The\nmodel was validated on an temporally-independent cohort of 90 patients from the\nsame institution (external validation). The diagnostic accuracy of the AI-CAC\nmodel assessed by the area under the curve (AUC) was the primary outcome.\nOverall, median AI-CAC score was 35 (0-388) and 28.9% patients had no AI-CAC.\nAUC of the AI-CAC model to identify a CAC>0 was 0.90 in the internal validation\ncohort and 0.77 in the external validation cohort.

The presented\nmethodology is based on conventional neural network-based survival models that\nare trained using data that is continuously gathered and stored at specific\ntimes, called snapshots. An important property of this type of training data is\nthat it can contain more than one snapshot from a specific individual which\nresults in that standard maximum likelihood training can not be directly\napplied since the data is not independent. However, the papers show that if the\ndata is in a specific format where all snapshot times are the same for all\nindividuals, called homogeneously sampled, maximum likelihood training can be\napplied and produce desirable results. In many cases, the data is not\nhomogeneously sampled and in this case, it is proposed to resample the data to\nmake it homogeneously sampled. How densely the dataset is sampled turns out to\nbe an important parameter; it should be chosen large enough to produce good\nresults, but this also increases the size of the dataset which makes training\nslow. To reduce the number of samples needed during training, the paper also\nproposes a technique to, instead of resampling the dataset once before the\ntraining starts, randomly resample the dataset at the start of each epoch\nduring the training. The proposed methodology is evaluated on both a simulated\ndataset and an experimental dataset of starter battery failures.

While the effect of\ndelays has been extensively studied for optimization, the manner in which they\ninteract with the underlying Markov process to shape the finite-time\nperformance of SA remains poorly understood. In this context, our first main\ncontribution is to show that under time-varying bounded delays, the delayed SA\nupdate rule guarantees exponentially fast convergence of the \\emph{last\niterate} to a ball around the SA operator's fixed point. Notably, our bound is\n\\emph{tight} in its dependence on both the maximum delay $\\tau_{max}$, and the\nmixing time $\\tau_{mix}$. To achieve this tight bound, we develop a novel\ninductive proof technique that, unlike various existing delayed-optimization\nanalyses, relies on establishing uniform boundedness of the iterates. As such,\nour proof may be of independent interest. Next, to mitigate the impact of the\nmaximum delay on the convergence rate, we provide the first finite-time\nanalysis of a delay-adaptive SA scheme under Markovian sampling.

The effects of such heterogeneity\nplay an important role for tissue function, and hence it is of critical to\ndiscover and understand the distribution of such fiber orientations from\nexperimental measurements, such as the digital image correlation data. To this\nend, we introduce the heterogeneous peridynamic neural operator (HeteroPNO)\napproach, for data-driven constitutive modeling of heterogeneous anisotropic\nmaterials. The goal is to learn both a nonlocal constitutive law together with\nthe material microstructure, in the form of a heterogeneous fiber orientation\nfield, from loading field-displacement field measurements. To this end, we\npropose a two-phase learning approach.

Then, in the second phase we reinitialize the learnt bond force and the\nkernel function, and training them together with a fiber orientation field for\neach material point. Owing to the state-based peridynamic skeleton, our\nHeteroPNO-learned material models are objective and have the balance of linear\nand angular momentum guaranteed.

Unfortunately, the energy consumption\nand decision latency are not robust against adversaries. Researchers have\nrecently demonstrated that attackers can compute and submit so-called sponge\nexamples at inference time to increase the energy consumption and decision\nlatency of neural networks. In computer vision, the proposed strategy crafts\ninputs with less activation sparsity which could otherwise be used to\naccelerate the computation. In this paper, we analyze the mechanism how these\nenergy-latency attacks reduce activation sparsity. In particular, we find that\ninput uniformity is a key enabler. A uniform image, that is, an image with\nmostly flat, uniformly colored surfaces, triggers more activations due to a\nspecific interplay of convolution, batch normalization, and ReLU activation.\nBased on these insights, we propose two new simple, yet effective strategies\nfor crafting sponge examples: sampling images from a probability distribution\nand identifying dense, yet inconspicuous inputs in natural datasets.

To\ncompute ET0 using the FAO56-PM method, four main weather parameters are needed:\ntemperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation (SR). One way to make daily\nET0 estimations for future days is to use freely available weather forecast\nservices (WFSs), where many meteorological parameters are estimated up to the\nnext 15 days. A problem with this method is that currently, SR is not provided\nas a free forecast parameter on most of those online services or, normally,\nsuch forecasts present a financial cost penalty.

To address this scalability\nchallenge, we leverage the \"Residual-to-Residual DNN series for high-Dynamic\nrange imaging (R2D2)\" approach recently introduced in astronomical imaging.\nR2D2's reconstruction is formed as a series of residual images, iteratively\nestimated as outputs of DNNs taking the previous iteration's image estimate and\nassociated data residual as inputs. The method can be interpreted as a learned\nversion of the Matching Pursuit algorithm. We demonstrate R2D2 in simulation,\nconsidering radial k-space sampling acquisition sequences. Our preliminary\nresults suggest that R2D2 achieves: (i) suboptimal performance compared to its\nunrolled incarnation R2D2-Net, which is however non-scalable due to the\nnecessary embedding of NUFFT-based data-consistency layers; (ii) superior\nreconstruction quality to a scalable version of R2D2-Net embedding an FFT-based\napproximation for data consistency; (iii) superior reconstruction quality to\nPnP, while only requiring few iterations.\n","authors":["Yiwei Chen","Chao Tang","Amir Aghabiglou","Chung San Chu","Yves Wiaux"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17905v2.pdf","comment":"submitted to IEEE EUSIPCO 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18370v1","updated":"2024-03-27T09:06:36Z","published":"2024-03-27T09:06:36Z","title":"Ship in Sight: Diffusion Models for Ship-Image Super Resolution","summary":"  In recent years, remarkable advancements have been achieved in the field of\nimage generation, primarily driven by the escalating demand for high-quality\noutcomes across various image generation subtasks, such as inpainting,\ndenoising, and super resolution.

The convolutional neural network is used to represent spatial\ncorrelations of the mass-spring system, after which three branches are designed\nto learn linear, nonlinear, and time derivate features of cloth physics. The\nframework can also integrate with other external forces and collision handling\nthrough either traditional simulators or sub neural networks. The model is\ntested across different cloth animation cases, without training with new data.\nAgreement with baselines and predictive realism successfully validate its\ngeneralization ability. Inference efficiency of the proposed model also defeats\ntraditional physics simulation. This framework is also designed to easily\nintegrate with other visual refinement techniques like wrinkle carving, which\nleaves significant chances to incorporate prevailing macing learning techniques\nin 3D cloth amination.\n","authors":["Zhiwei Zhao"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12820v2.pdf","comment":"A derivation is incomplete, and updations are being processed"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18310v1","updated":"2024-03-27T07:22:32Z","published":"2024-03-27T07:22:32Z","title":"A thermodynamically consistent physics-informed deep learning material\n  model for short fiber/polymer nanocomposites","summary":"  This work proposes a physics-informed deep learning (PIDL)-based constitutive\nmodel for investigating the viscoelastic-viscoplastic behavior of short\nfiber-reinforced nanoparticle-filled epoxies under various ambient conditions.\nThe deep-learning model is trained to enforce thermodynamic principles, leading\nto a thermodynamically consistent constitutive model.

In this\npaper, we propose BridgeTower, which introduces multiple bridge layers that\nbuild a connection between the top layers of uni-modal encoders and each layer\nof the cross-modal encoder. This enables effective bottom-up cross-modal\nalignment and fusion between visual and textual representations of different\nsemantic levels of pre-trained uni-modal encoders in the cross-modal encoder.\nPre-trained with only 4M images, BridgeTower achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on various downstream vision-language tasks. In particular, on the\nVQAv2 test-std set, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of 78.73%, outperforming\nthe previous state-of-the-art model METER by 1.09% with the same pre-training\ndata and almost negligible additional parameters and computational costs.\nNotably, when further scaling the model, BridgeTower achieves an accuracy of\n81.15%, surpassing models that are pre-trained on orders-of-magnitude larger\ndatasets.

However, mitigating visual biases is challenging due to their\nunexplainable nature, often identified indirectly through visualization or\nsample statistics, which necessitates additional human supervision for\ninterpretation. To tackle this issue, we propose the Bias-to-Text (B2T)\nframework, which interprets visual biases as keywords. Specifically, we extract\ncommon keywords from the captions of mispredicted images to identify potential\nbiases in the model. We then validate these keywords by measuring their\nsimilarity to the mispredicted images using a vision-language scoring model.\nThe keyword explanation form of visual bias offers several advantages, such as\na clear group naming for bias discovery and a natural extension for debiasing\nusing these group names. Our experiments demonstrate that B2T can identify\nknown biases, such as gender bias in CelebA, background bias in Waterbirds, and\ndistribution shifts in ImageNet-R/C. Additionally, B2T uncovers novel biases in\nlarger datasets, such as Dollar Street and ImageNet. For example, we discovered\na contextual bias between \"bee\" and \"flower\" in ImageNet.

However,\nthis approach suffers from weak labelling, since the ground-truth\nhistopathology labels do not describe the properties of individual ROIs.\nRecently, multi-scale approaches have sought to mitigate this issue by\ncombining the context awareness of transformers with a CNN feature extractor to\ndetect cancer from multiple ROIs using multiple-instance learning (MIL). In\nthis work, we present a detailed study of several image transformer\narchitectures for both ROI-scale and multi-scale classification, and a\ncomparison of the performance of CNNs and transformers for ultrasound-based\nprostate cancer classification. We also design a novel multi-objective learning\nstrategy that combines both ROI and core predictions to further mitigate label\nnoise. METHODS: We evaluate 3 image transformers on ROI-scale cancer\nclassification, then use the strongest model to tune a multi-scale classifier\nwith MIL. We train our MIL models using our novel multi-objective learning\nstrategy and compare our results to existing baselines. RESULTS: We find that\nfor both ROI-scale and multi-scale PCa detection, image transformer backbones\nlag behind their CNN counterparts. This deficit in performance is even more\nnoticeable for larger models. When using multi-objective learning, we can\nimprove performance of MIL, with a 77.9% AUROC, a sensitivity of 75.9%, and a\nspecificity of 66.3%. CONCLUSION: Convolutional networks are better suited for\nmodelling sparse datasets of prostate ultrasounds, producing more robust\nfeatures than transformers in PCa detection. Multi-scale methods remain the\nbest architecture for this task, with multi-objective learning presenting an\neffective way to improve performance.\n","authors":["Mohamed Harmanani","Paul F. R.

This paper presents CAFE, a Compact, Adaptive,\nand Fast Embedding compression framework that addresses the above requirements.\nThe design philosophy of CAFE is to dynamically allocate more memory resources\nto important features (called hot features), and allocate less memory to\nunimportant ones. In CAFE, we propose a fast and lightweight sketch data\nstructure, named HotSketch, to capture feature importance and report hot\nfeatures in real time. For each reported hot feature, we assign it a unique\nembedding. For the non-hot features, we allow multiple features to share one\nembedding by using hash embedding technique.

When assigning meta-embeddings, most\nexisting methods are a heuristically designed, predefined mapping from each\nuser's/item's ID to the corresponding meta-embedding indexes, thus simplifying\nthe optimization problem into learning only the meta-embeddings. However, in\nthe context of GNN-based collaborative filtering, such a fixed mapping omits\nthe semantic correlations between entities that are evident in the user-item\ninteraction graph, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. To this\nend, we propose Lightweight Embeddings for Graph Collaborative Filtering\n(LEGCF), a parameter-efficient embedding framework dedicated to GNN-based\nrecommenders. LEGCF innovatively introduces an assignment matrix as an extra\nlearnable component on top of meta-embeddings. To jointly optimize these two\nheavily entangled components, aside from learning the meta-embeddings by\nminimizing the recommendation loss, LEGCF further performs efficient assignment\nupdate by enforcing a novel semantic similarity constraint and finding its\nclosed-form solution based on matrix pseudo-inverse. The meta-embeddings and\nassignment matrix are alternately updated, where the latter is sparsified on\nthe fly to ensure negligible storage overhead. Extensive experiments on three\nbenchmark datasets have verified LEGCF's smallest trade-off between size and\nperformance, with consistent accuracy gain over state-of-the-art baselines.

Most of the existing works focus on improving\nthe representation ability for the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token\nand calculate relevance using textual semantic similarity. However, in the\nlegal domain, textual semantic similarity does not always imply that the cases\nare relevant enough. Instead, relevance in legal cases primarily depends on the\nsimilarity of key facts that impact the final judgment. Without proper\ntreatments, the discriminative ability of learned representations could be\nlimited since legal cases are lengthy and contain numerous non-key facts. To\nthis end, we introduce DELTA, a discriminative model designed for legal case\nretrieval. The basic idea involves pinpointing key facts in legal cases and\npulling the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token closer to the key facts\nwhile pushing away from the non-key facts, which can warm up the case embedding\nspace in an unsupervised manner. To be specific, this study brings the word\nalignment mechanism to the contextual masked auto-encoder. First, we leverage\nshallow decoders to create information bottlenecks, aiming to enhance the\nrepresentation ability. Second, we employ the deep decoder to enable\ntranslation between different structures, with the goal of pinpointing key\nfacts to enhance discriminative ability.

This poses several unique challenges for click-through rate (CTR)\nprediction. Due to limited user interactions for each product (i.e. item), the\ncorresponding item embedding in the CTR model may not easily converge. This\nmakes the conventional sequence modeling based approaches cannot effectively\nutilize user history information since historical user behaviors contain a\nmixture of items with different volume of stocks. Particularly, the attention\nmechanism in a sequence model tends to assign higher score to products with\nmore accumulated user interactions, making limited-stock products being ignored\nand contribute less to the final output. To this end, we propose the Meta-Split\nNetwork (MSNet) to split user history sequence regarding to the volume of stock\nfor each product, and adopt differentiated modeling approaches for different\nsequences. As for the limited-stock products, a meta-learning approach is\napplied to address the problem of inconvergence, which is achieved by designing\nmeta scaling and shifting networks with ID and side information.

Traditional\nsequential recommendation methods rely on capturing implicit collaborative\nfiltering signals among items. Recent relation-aware sequential recommendation\nmodels have achieved promising performance by explicitly incorporating item\nrelations into the modeling of user historical sequences, where most relations\nare extracted from knowledge graphs. However, existing methods rely on manually\npredefined relations and suffer the sparsity issue, limiting the generalization\nability in diverse scenarios with varied item relations. In this paper, we\npropose a novel relation-aware sequential recommendation framework with Latent\nRelation Discovery (LRD). Different from previous relation-aware models that\nrely on predefined rules, we propose to leverage the Large Language Model (LLM)\nto provide new types of relations and connections between items.

These representations are fed into a latent\nrelation discovery module based on the discrete state variational autoencoder\n(DVAE). Then the self-supervised relation discovery tasks and recommendation\ntasks are jointly optimized.

In\npractice, these systems require substantial traffic sampling to reconcile the\nhigh data plane packet rates with the comparatively slower processing speeds of\nML detection. As sampling significantly reduces traffic observability, it\nfundamentally undermines their detection capability.\n  We present Peregrine, an ML-based malicious traffic detector for Terabit\nnetworks. The key idea is to run the detection process partially in the network\ndata plane. Specifically, we offload the detector's ML feature computation to a\ncommodity switch. The Peregrine switch processes a diversity of features\nper-packet, at Tbps line rates - three orders of magnitude higher than the\nfastest detector - to feed the ML-based component in the control plane. Our\noffloading approach presents a distinct advantage. While, in practice, current\nsystems sample raw traffic, in Peregrine sampling occurs after feature\ncomputation. This essential trait enables computing features over all traffic,\nsignificantly enhancing detection performance. The Peregrine detector is not\nonly effective for Terabit networks, but it is also energy- and cost-efficient.\nFurther, by shifting a compute-heavy component to the switch, it saves precious\nCPU cycles and improves detection throughput.\n","authors":["João Romeiras Amado","Francisco Pereira","David Pissarra","Salvatore Signorello","Miguel Correia","Fernando M.

Despite an increasingly\nlanguage-diverse online community, in which many Internet users consume news in\nmultiple languages, the majority of news recommendation focuses on major,\nresource-rich languages, and English in particular. Moreover, nearly all news\nrecommendation efforts assume monolingual news consumption, whereas more and\nmore users tend to consume information in at least two languages. Accordingly,\nthe existing body of work on news recommendation suffers from a lack of\npublicly available multilingual benchmarks that would catalyze development of\nnews recommenders effective in multilingual settings and for low-resource\nlanguages. Aiming to fill this gap, we introduce xMIND, an open, multilingual\nnews recommendation dataset derived from the English MIND dataset using machine\ntranslation, covering a set of 14 linguistically and geographically diverse\nlanguages, with digital footprints of varying sizes. Using xMIND, we\nsystematically benchmark several state-of-the-art content-based neural news\nrecommenders (NNRs) in both zero-shot (ZS-XLT) and few-shot (FS-XLT)\ncross-lingual transfer scenarios, considering both monolingual and bilingual\nnews consumption patterns. Our findings reveal that (i) current NNRs, even when\nbased on a multilingual language model, suffer from substantial performance\nlosses under ZS-XLT and that (ii) inclusion of target-language data in FS-XLT\ntraining has limited benefits, particularly when combined with a bilingual news\nconsumption. Our findings thus warrant a broader research effort in\nmultilingual and cross-lingual news recommendation.

A desired model for this problem should\nsatisfy the following requirements: 1) Accuracy: the model should achieve\nfine-grained accuracy with respect to any conversion type in any display\nscenario. 2) Scalability: the model parameter size should be affordable. 3)\nConvenience: the model should not require a large amount of effort in data\npartitioning, subset processing and separate storage. Existing approaches\ncannot simultaneously satisfy these requirements. For example, building a\nseparate model for each (conversion type, display scenario) pair is neither\nscalable nor convenient. Building a unified model trained on all the data with\nconversion type and display scenario included as two features is not accurate\nenough.

Investigating and Mitigating Prompt Bias\n  in Factual Knowledge Extraction","summary":"  Recent research shows that pre-trained language models (PLMs) suffer from\n\"prompt bias\" in factual knowledge extraction, i.e., prompts tend to introduce\nbiases toward specific labels. Prompt bias presents a significant challenge in\nassessing the factual knowledge within PLMs. Therefore, this paper aims to\nimprove the reliability of existing benchmarks by thoroughly investigating and\nmitigating prompt bias. We show that: 1) all prompts in the experiments exhibit\nnon-negligible bias, with gradient-based prompts like AutoPrompt and OptiPrompt\ndisplaying significantly higher levels of bias; 2) prompt bias can amplify\nbenchmark accuracy unreasonably by overfitting the test datasets, especially on\nimbalanced datasets like LAMA. Based on these findings, we propose a\nrepresentation-based approach to mitigate the prompt bias during inference\ntime. Specifically, we first estimate the biased representation using\nprompt-only querying, and then remove it from the model's internal\nrepresentations to generate the debiased representations, which are used to\nproduce the final debiased outputs. Experiments across various prompts, PLMs,\nand benchmarks show that our approach can not only correct the overfitted\nperformance caused by prompt bias, but also significantly improve the prompt\nretrieval capability (up to 10% absolute performance gain). These results\nindicate that our approach effectively alleviates prompt bias in knowledge\nevaluation, thereby enhancing the reliability of benchmark assessments.\nHopefully, our plug-and-play approach can be a golden standard to strengthen\nPLMs toward reliable knowledge bases.

While the context-processing delay can be reduced by\nreusing the KV cache of a context across different inputs, fetching the KV\ncache, which contains large tensors, over the network can cause extra network\ndelays.\n  CacheGen is a fast context-loading module for LLM systems. First, CacheGen\nuses a custom tensor encoder, which embraces KV cache's distributional\nproperties, to encode a KV cache into more compact bitstream representations\nwith negligible encoding/decoding overhead. This reduces the bandwidth demand\nto fetch the KV cache. Second, to maintain low context-loading delay and high\ngeneration quality, CacheGen adapts the streaming strategies to cope with\nchanges in available bandwidth. When available bandwidth drops, CacheGen may\nraise the compression level for a part of the context or choose to recompute\nits KV cache on the fly. We test CacheGen on four popular LLMs of various sizes\nand four datasets (662 contexts in total). Compared to the recent systems that\nreuse the KV cache, CacheGen reduces the KV cache size by 3.7-4.3x and the\ntotal delay in fetching and processing contexts by 2.7-3.2x while having\nnegligible impact on the LLM response quality in accuracy or perplexity.\n","authors":["Yuhan Liu","Hanchen Li","Yihua Cheng","Siddhant Ray","Yuyang Huang","Qizheng Zhang","Kuntai Du","Jiayi Yao","Shan Lu","Ganesh Ananthanarayanan","Michael Maire","Henry Hoffmann","Ari Holtzman","Junchen Jiang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07240v4.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16855v1","updated":"2024-03-25T15:18:23Z","published":"2024-03-25T15:18:23Z","title":"Semantic-Aware Remote Estimation of Multiple Markov Sources Under\n  Constraints","summary":"  This paper studies semantic-aware communication for remote estimation of\nmultiple Markov sources over a lossy and rate-constrained channel.

As a\ncritical (or could even be the most important) step that significantly impacts\nthe execution performance of the query plan, such analysis and attempts should\nnot be missed. From another aspect, existing query optimizers are usually\nrule-based or rule-based + cost-based, i.e., they are dependent on manually\ncreated rules to complete the query plan rewrite/transformation. Given the fact\nthat modern optimizers include hundreds to thousands of rules, designing a\nmulti-modal query optimizer following a similar way is significantly\ntime-consuming since we will have to enumerate as many multi-modal optimization\nrules as possible, which has not been well addressed today. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the query optimization ability of LLM and use LLM to design LaPuda,\na novel LLM and Policy based multi-modal query optimizer. Instead of\nenumerating specific and detailed rules, LaPuda only needs a few abstract\npolicies to guide LLM in the optimization, by which much time and human effort\nare saved.

However, despite\nInformation Retrieval (IR) models using LLMs as the backbone of their\narchitectures, nearly all of them still only take queries as input, with no\ninstructions. For the handful of recent models that do take instructions, it's\nunclear how they use them. We introduce our dataset FollowIR, which contains a\nrigorous instruction evaluation benchmark as well as a training set for helping\nIR models learn to better follow real-world instructions. FollowIR builds off\nthe long history of the TREC conferences: as TREC provides human annotators\nwith instructions (also known as narratives) to determine document relevance,\nso should IR models be able to understand and decide relevance based on these\ndetailed instructions. Our evaluation benchmark starts with three deeply judged\nTREC collections and alters the annotator instructions, re-annotating relevant\ndocuments. Through this process, we can measure how well IR models follow\ninstructions, through a new pairwise evaluation framework. Our results indicate\nthat existing retrieval models fail to correctly use instructions, using them\nfor basic keywords and struggling to understand long-form information. However,\nwe show that it is possible for IR models to learn to follow complex\ninstructions: our new FollowIR-7B model has significant improvements (over 13%)\nafter fine-tuning on our training set.\n","authors":["Orion Weller","Benjamin Chang","Sean MacAvaney","Kyle Lo","Arman Cohan","Benjamin Van Durme","Dawn Lawrie","Luca Soldaini"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15246v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15520v1","updated":"2024-03-22T12:22:44Z","published":"2024-03-22T12:22:44Z","title":"GTC: GNN-Transformer Co-contrastive Learning for Self-supervised\n  Heterogeneous Graph Representation","summary":"  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the most powerful weapon for\nvarious graph tasks due to the message-passing mechanism's great local\ninformation aggregation ability. However, over-smoothing has always hindered\nGNNs from going deeper and capturing multi-hop neighbors. Unlike GNNs,\nTransformers can model global information and multi-hop interactions via\nmulti-head self-attention and a proper Transformer structure can show more\nimmunity to the over-smoothing problem. So, can we propose a novel framework to\ncombine GNN and Transformer, integrating both GNN's local information\naggregation and Transformer's global information modeling ability to eliminate\nthe over-smoothing problem? To realize this, this paper proposes a\ncollaborative learning scheme for GNN-Transformer and constructs GTC\narchitecture. GTC leverages the GNN and Transformer branch to encode node\ninformation from different views respectively, and establishes contrastive\nlearning tasks based on the encoded cross-view information to realize\nself-supervised heterogeneous graph representation. For the Transformer branch,\nwe propose Metapath-aware Hop2Token and CG-Hetphormer, which can cooperate with\nGNN to attentively encode neighborhood information from different levels. As\nfar as we know, this is the first attempt in the field of graph representation\nlearning to utilize both GNN and Transformer to collaboratively capture\ndifferent view information and conduct cross-view contrastive learning.

However, they ignore that the\ndifference relation density of nodes between the user- and item-side causes the\nadaptability of graphs on bilateral nodes to be different after multi-hop graph\ninteraction calculation, which limits existing models to achieve ideal results.\nTo solve this issue, we propose a novel framework for recommendation tasks\ncalled Bilateral Unsymmetrical Graph Contrastive Learning (BusGCL) that\nconsider the bilateral unsymmetry on user-item node relation density for sliced\nuser and item graph reasoning better with bilateral slicing contrastive\ntraining. Especially, taking into account the aggregation ability of\nhypergraph-based graph convolutional network (GCN) in digging implicit\nsimilarities is more suitable for user nodes, embeddings generated from three\ndifferent modules: hypergraph-based GCN, GCN and perturbed GCN, are sliced into\ntwo subviews by the user- and item-side respectively, and selectively combined\ninto subview pairs bilaterally based on the characteristics of inter-node\nrelation structure. Furthermore, to align the distribution of user and item\nembeddings after aggregation, a dispersing loss is leveraged to adjust the\nmutual distance between all embeddings for maintaining learning ability.\nComprehensive experiments on two public datasets have proved the superiority of\nBusGCL in comparison to various recommendation methods.

To avoid fine-tuning, we can alternatively\ntreat a LLM as a black-box (i.e., freeze the parameters of the LLM) and augment\nit with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, namely black-box RAG.\nRecently, black-box RAG has achieved success in knowledge-intensive tasks and\nhas gained much attention. Existing black-box RAG methods typically fine-tune\nthe retriever to cater to LLMs' preferences and concatenate all the retrieved\ndocuments as the input, which suffers from two issues: (1) Ignorance of Factual\nInformation. The LLM preferred documents may not contain the factual\ninformation for the given question, which can mislead the retriever and hurt\nthe effectiveness of black-box RAG; (2) Waste of Tokens. Simply concatenating\nall the retrieved documents brings large amounts of unnecessary tokens for\nLLMs, which degenerates the efficiency of black-box RAG. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes a novel black-box RAG framework which utilizes the\nfactual information in the retrieval and reduces the number of tokens for\naugmentation, dubbed FIT-RAG.

They have to either discard historical data and\nuse only the most recent data or reprocess the old and new data jointly. Both\ncases incur substantial computational overhead. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce User Stateful Embedding (USE). USE generates user embeddings and\nreflects users' evolving behaviors without the need for exhaustive reprocessing\nby storing previous model states and revisiting them in the future.\nFurthermore, we introduce a novel training objective named future W-behavior\nprediction to transcend the limitations of next-token prediction by forecasting\na broader horizon of upcoming user behaviors. By combining it with the Same\nUser Prediction, a contrastive learning-based objective that predicts whether\ndifferent segments of behavior sequences belong to the same user, we further\nimprove the embeddings' distinctiveness and representativeness. We conducted\nexperiments on 8 downstream tasks using Snapchat users' behavioral logs in both\nstatic (i.e., fixed user behavior sequences) and dynamic (i.e., periodically\nupdated user behavior sequences) settings. We demonstrate USE's superior\nperformance over established baselines. The results underscore USE's\neffectiveness and efficiency in integrating historical and recent user behavior\nsequences into user embeddings in dynamic user modeling.\n","authors":["Zhihan Zhou","Qixiang Fang","Leonardo Neves","Francesco Barbieri","Yozen Liu","Han Liu","Maarten W.

However, when items in the recommendation\nscenarios contain rich textual information, such as product descriptions in\nonline shopping or news headlines on social media, LLMs require longer texts to\ncomprehensively depict the historical user behavior sequence. This poses\nsignificant challenges to LLM-based recommenders, such as over-length\nlimitations, extensive time and space overheads, and suboptimal model\nperformance. To this end, in this paper, we design a novel framework for\nharnessing Large Language Models for Text-Rich Sequential Recommendation\n(LLM-TRSR). Specifically, we first propose to segment the user historical\nbehaviors and subsequently employ an LLM-based summarizer for summarizing these\nuser behavior blocks. Particularly, drawing inspiration from the successful\napplication of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNN) models in user modeling, we introduce two unique summarization\ntechniques in this paper, respectively hierarchical summarization and recurrent\nsummarization. Then, we construct a prompt text encompassing the user\npreference summary, recent user interactions, and candidate item information\ninto an LLM-based recommender, which is subsequently fine-tuned using\nSupervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) techniques to yield our final recommendation\nmodel.

In this paper, we first systematically\ninvestigate the misalignment issue in multimodal recommendations, and propose a\nsolution named AlignRec. In AlignRec, the recommendation objective is\ndecomposed into three alignments, namely alignment within contents, alignment\nbetween content and categorical ID, and alignment between users and items.

To effectively train our\nAlignRec, we propose starting from pre-training the first alignment to obtain\nunified multimodal features and subsequently training the following two\nalignments together with these features as input. As it is essential to analyze\nwhether each multimodal feature helps in training, we design three new classes\nof metrics to evaluate intermediate performance.

In recent years, neural retrievers based on pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLM), such as dual-encoders, have achieved huge success. Yet,\nstudies have found that the performance of dual-encoders are often limited due\nto the neglecting of the interaction information between queries and candidate\npassages. Therefore, various interaction paradigms have been proposed to\nimprove the performance of vanilla dual-encoders. Particularly, recent\nstate-of-the-art methods often introduce late-interaction during the model\ninference process. However, such late-interaction based methods usually bring\nextensive computation and storage cost on large corpus. Despite their\neffectiveness, the concern of efficiency and space footprint is still an\nimportant factor that limits the application of interaction-based neural\nretrieval models. To tackle this issue, we incorporate implicit interaction\ninto dual-encoders, and propose I^3 retriever. In particular, our implicit\ninteraction paradigm leverages generated pseudo-queries to simulate\nquery-passage interaction, which jointly optimizes with query and passage\nencoders in an end-to-end manner. It can be fully pre-computed and cached, and\nits inference process only involves simple dot product operation of the query\nvector and passage vector, which makes it as efficient as the vanilla dual\nencoders. We conduct comprehensive experiments on MSMARCO and TREC2019 Deep\nLearning Datasets, demonstrating the I^3 retriever's superiority in terms of\nboth effectiveness and efficiency.

Relevance feedback techniques with implicit user\nfeedback (e.g., clicks) have been demonstrated to be effective in traditional\nsearch tasks (e.g., Web search). In legal case retrieval, however, collecting\nrelevance feedback faces a couple of challenges that are difficult to resolve\nunder existing feedback paradigms. First, legal case retrieval is a complex\ntask as users often need to understand the relationship between legal cases in\ndetail to correctly judge their relevance. Traditional feedback signal such as\nclicks is too coarse to use as they do not reflect any fine-grained relevance\ninformation. Second, legal case documents are usually long, users often need\neven tens of minutes to read and understand them. Simple behavior signal such\nas clicks and eye-tracking fixations can hardly be useful when users almost\nclick and examine every part of the document. In this paper, we explore the\npossibility of solving the feedback problem in legal case retrieval with brain\nsignal.

Therefore, we propose a\nframework for legal case retrieval that uses EEG signal to optimize retrieval\nresults.

Our proposed features achieve a 71% accuracy for feedback\nprediction with an SVM-RFE model, and our proposed ranking method that takes\ninto account the diverse needs of users can significantly improve user\nsatisfaction for legal case retrieval.
